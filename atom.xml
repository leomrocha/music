    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Getting into music.</h1>

<p>Learning is a tough, long, wonderful process.</p>

<p>There is a magic, wonderful and amazing excitement and emotion when we fulfill something.
And that magic can only be felt if and only if, we spent our time perfecting for that moment.</p>

<p>There is no (actual) pleasure in things that come so easy to us, but the wonderful emotion that pours from us when we succeed at something comples, it makes it all.</p>

<p>That is why people climb mountains, and then sits at the top, looking at everything. I&rsquo;ve done it, and there are no words to describe the feeling.</p>

<p>What about music?</p>

<p>Well, every time I manage to make a song sound nice enough, I feel an enourmous pleasure.</p>

<p>One of my goals is to be able to play, compose and learn music, beter and faster.</p>

<p>For this, I think that I should learn music theory, and as learning it alone is difficult, and I know I need a guide, I subscribed at the courses here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Developing Your Musicianship &ndash; Cursera &ndash; Berklee College of Music &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002">https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002</a></li>
<li>Fundamentals of Music Theory &ndash; Cursera &ndash; University of Edinburg &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001">https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001</a></li>
</ol>


<p>The courses are already started, but then there is a goal and the challenge is a medium term one:</p>

<pre><code>**Finish both courses, with all the drills completed**
</code></pre>

<p>The short term goals are:</p>

<pre><code>1. Finish (at least) one lesson each week
2. Practice aplying the theory with the instrument at least 15 minutes every day
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>How am I doing? &ndash; Second week</h1>

<p>After working now for 2 weeks on this project, I&rsquo;ve realized that one of the most difficult things is to keep a discipline.</p>

<p>The first week was a <strong>success</strong>, putting online the musicpaste.com service.</p>

<p>For the second week, putting all the other things online, I realised one thing:
<strong>The goal was not specific enough.</strong> And that, made it difficult.</p>

<p>Also, there where the mandatory parts of the sites that takes time but adds no value: the terms and conditions and all the legal points that must be fulfilled to comply with EU regulations (I live in France).</p>

<p>Also, while I&rsquo;m starting at learning music theory, I&rsquo;ve noticed that the lack of structure is just so difficult.</p>

<p>So, now I&rsquo;ve decided a few things:
 1. I will try to set better goals for better understanding
 2. I will be taking online courses from Cursera and Udacity</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll explain more of this goals in specific blog posts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Love &amp; Passion</h1>

<p>Yes, those 2 words describe the amazing feeling while I play.</p>

<p>Yes, those 2 words describe the incredible sensations that passed through my veins while listening
to an orchestra that first night I arrived to London and my friend took me to the Royal Albert Hall.</p>

<p>That is why, this blog will document my learning, and I will be writing for me and for you to be able to follow.
I want to not only learn, but to share and to build new tools (I&rsquo;m a Computer Engineer) that help others as well as myself.</p>

<p>I am thrilled (and terrified) about this idea of publicly documenting all my progress. Let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>

<p>Yes, Love &amp; Passion describe what I feel about music, join me in this quest.</p>

<p>Write to you soon!</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Leo</p>
