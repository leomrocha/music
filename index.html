			Studying Piano - Czerny Op.599 - 1</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>Music inspires a passion that cannot be explained by words</strong></p>

<h1>Starting from the beginning</h1>

<p>As an amateur guitar player, I&rsquo;ve spent many years <em>&ldquo;playing&rdquo;</em> without actually knowing what was I doing.
I have a nice music intuition, so I&rsquo;ve been able to pull up with <em>learning by ear</em> and with <em>TABs</em>
But after a while I hitted a roadblock, and what blocked me was the lack of understanding of the music.</p>

<p>The conclusion:</p>

<p>I should start studying music theory, and getting to deeply understand it.</p>

<p>So, I started a few weeks ago with a couple of online courses, I repeat here the links:</p>

<ol>
<li>Developing Your Musicianship &ndash; Cursera &ndash; Berklee College of Music &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002">https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002</a></li>
<li>Fundamentals of Music Theory &ndash; Cursera &ndash; University of Edinburg &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001">https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001</a></li>
</ol>


<p>Starting from the beginning allowed me to improve a lot in a few weeks.</p>

<h1>Learning piano</h1>

<p>For a long time I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of a piano. Piano and violin are two instruments that caught my attention since I was a toddler, but I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to do it. I got a guitar instead (and now I <strong>love</strong> guitars too).</p>

<p>So I bought the piano (thanks to all the ones who participated to help me buy this as a birthday gift! specially my girlfriend whom made the whole organization for it) and now the question was:</p>

<p> Do I keep on doing the same thing? or should I actually start from the beginning</p>

<h2>Czerny Op. 599 &ndash; First exercise</h2>

<p>I started trying to read for the right and left hand and then going on with the whole exercise.</p>

<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve been able to read and do some things, this way didn&rsquo;t work as expected, and I kept on repeating many mistakes.</p>

<p>So I decided I&rsquo;ll analyze the exercise to understand it better,</p>

<p>I could extract the following facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s in <strong>C Major</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>tonic</strong> is <strong>C Major</strong></li>
<li>The mode is <strong>ionian</strong> because of the <strong>Tonic</strong></li>
<li>The clef for the right and left hand is the <strong>trebble</strong> clef</li>
</ul>


<p>I decided to extract 6 different parts of the exercise and this way I could practice better.</p>

<p>I practiced without schedule, some days a lot (up to one hour) some days a little (a few minutes), and even with the piano off. Anyway, the important is that all my senses get sharpened.</p>

<p>To cut it down I decided to practice individually the right and left hands. Also, I decided I would practice the measures in the following blocks and order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Measures 1,2 (the same as 3,4)</li>
<li>Measures 3</li>
<li>Measures 5,6</li>
<li>Measures 7,8</li>
<li>Measures 5 &ndash; 8</li>
<li>Measures 1 &ndash; 8</li>
<li>Measures 9,10</li>
<li>Measures 11,12</li>
<li>Measures 15,16</li>
<li> Measures 9 &ndash; 12</li>
<li> Measures 13 &ndash; 16</li>
<li> Measures 9 &ndash; 16</li>
</ol>


<p>Seems complex, but actually made me understand it better.</p>

<p>The right hand:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The whole melody (sorry about the notation that is for guitar, but VexTab doesn&rsquo;t yet support piano voices, so I&rsquo;ll put it only for you to be able to listen to the melody)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Yes, studying music takes time, and I love doing it, there is not one second I&rsquo;d rather be doing something else.</p>

<hr/>


<p>I should start recording myself and uploading the recordings &hellip; that&rsquo;s a good challenge for next week!</p>

			Last Week Sumup</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;m making this posts so I can learn more and better, and this week has been quite interesting.</p>

<p>The word <strong>lean</strong> in the blog theme is not because it should be easy, or fast, or no waste. But because the goal is to minimize the non-useful things, processes and be able to iterate <strong>fast</strong> and discard things that are not working.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve found out this week is that is not necesary the best idea to write a blog post per video in the lessons.</p>

<p>The second week of taking lessons was really interesting, I&rsquo;ve made lots of progress on my music just in this two weeks that I am really motivated to keep on studying.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still too impulsive and I have to improve my discipline with music.
I&rsquo;m used to playingwith my guitar, but discipline to actually study music is not my strongest point.</p>

<p>My new piano arrived Thursday night, and after that I was compeltely distracted with trying things, reading the manual, connecting it to the computer, etc. Luckily there are two friends at home now and both play piano well, so I&rsquo;ve been able to listen to nice things.</p>

<p>I tried playing some things. I was amazed how much could I really understand and do! I was waiting for not being able to do anything at all, but at least I&rsquo;ve been able to play a couple of melodies by ear, and start playing the first exercise of one of Czerny&rsquo;s piano methods!</p>

<p>I tested the USB-MIDI interface, is working great, and I&rsquo;m trying to find out how to build something that will help me in my learning path with it now. It will be web and I hope will be useful for other people too.</p>

<p>So, going to last week&rsquo;s goals:</p>

<p><strong>Last week goals:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Do all the lessons of week 2 of both courses &ndash;> DONE</li>
<li>Write posts that include all the theory of both courses up to the end of lesson 2 &ndash;> DONE (in a different way that the planned)</li>
<li><p>Having practiced 15 minutes every day (playing for fun doesn&rsquo;t count) &ndash;> MMMM, I&rsquo;ve practiced but not enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Having in paper (or in the computer) a detail of the tools (at least ear training and scale practice tools) &ndash;> plan changed, will do something more basic and easier first.</p></li>
<li>Having a decition and action plan written down for which tool to start working on next &ndash;> Changed, will create a web version of VMPK, but with synesthesia and be able to extend it for the learning tools later.</li>
<li>Having fixed the problem I found in musicpaste, as extra, having added (or started) working on another feature on the TODO list &ndash;> DONE, the fix. No extra</li>
</ul>


<h2>What&rsquo;s next</h2>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve written down my sumup, now the important part that follows, the <strong>ACTIONS</strong> to take for next week.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<ul>
<li>Keep on doing the lessons</li>
<li>Watch one or two videos (if they seem to be related) and write a blog post for each on the theory</li>
<li>Start writing down the exercises and drills that I do for the Musicianship course and post them. Do this after each video where practice is involved.</li>
<li>Warm-up better before starting to play</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Success measures:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Do all the lessons of week 3 of both courses</li>
<li>Write posts that include all the theory of both courses up to the end of lesson 3</li>
<li>Write down at least 2 drills for piano and 2 for guitar.</li>
<li>Having practiced 15 minutes every day (playing for fun doesn&rsquo;t count)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Services</h3>

<ul>
<li>Start the WMPK page (VMPK web port for Chrome)</li>
<li>Make one improvement to <a href="http://musicpaste.com" title="MusicPaste">MusicPaste</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Success measures:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Having a simple AngularJS web page that can read and show on screen the midi input from the piano and can send midi instructions to the piano.</li>
<li>Having added (or started if it&rsquo;s complex) one feature in the TODO list</li>
</ul>

			Lesson 2 - Fundamentals of Music Theory - Keys</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On this post I&rsquo;ll review some points that I feel important, I will ignore some things that I feel are not so much, and I&rsquo;ll add some other points that I feel makes me understand things better.</p>

<h1>Keys, Key Signatures &amp; Scales</h1>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)" title="Key">Key</a> definition on wikipedia</p>

<p>Complex concept that contains different ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>The  relationship and emotion that a piece or part of a piece has.</li>
<li>The <strong>tonic</strong> that gives the name a <strong>key</strong>, when we listen, is the one that attracts and feels that there the music rests.</li>
<li>All tension is resolved when the piece returns to the <strong>key</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Lets look at different scales, that correspond to different keys.</p>

<p>If we look a piece in the respective <strong>key</strong> of the <strong>tonic</strong> of each scale,
Always the same note will have the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_(music)" title="Accidental">accidental</a> before.</p>

<p>We can give this information beforehand and make writing a piece easier using what is called a <strong>Key Signature</strong></p>

<p>(see example in graphics below in key signature seccion)</p>

<h2>Key Signature</h2>

<p><strong>Key Signature</strong> is a way of writing music accidentals at the begginig of the stave. this has two effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplifies the writing</li>
<li>Gives us from the start information about what will happen during the piece</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signature" title="Key Signature">Key Signature</a> definition on wikipedia</p>

<p>Lets see all the scales, with and without the <strong>Key Signature</strong> written:</p>

<p></p>

<p>We can see that writing the key signature simplifies the writing and more clear</p>

<h2>Circles of 5ths and Circle of 4th</h2>

<p>To find the circle of 4ths, 5ths, etc we have to <strong>jump</strong> this interval to get to the following note until we find the first note name with wich we started</p>

<h3>Circle of Fifths</h3>

<p>Lets take all the notes and let&rsquo;s jump starting from the <strong>C (Do)</strong> in perfect 5ths.
So we have:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> C(Do) </th>
<th> G(Sol) </th>
<th> D(Re) </th>
<th> A(La) </th>
<th> E(Mi) </th>
<th> B(Si) </th>
<th> F#(Fa#) </th>
<th> Db(Re b) </th>
<th> Ab(La b) </th>
<th> Eb(Mi b) </th>
<th> Bb(Si b) </th>
<th> F(Fa) </th>
<th> C(Do) </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>The itervals are always 7 semitones (perfect 5ths)</p>

<h3>Circle of Fourths</h3>

<p>First lets again number the notes and start going up in fourths</p>

<p>The same as before, but now we&rsquo;ll be going in perfect 4ths, it&rsquo;s the same to say, every 5 semitones.</p>

<p>We can observe that as the circle of 5ths advances by 7 semitones, and the octave contains 12, the circle of 4ths will be the reverse of the circle of 5ths. Let&rsquo;s do it only for the major. Then we can count it for the relative minors too.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> C(Do) </th>
<th> F(Fa) </th>
<th> Bb(Si b) </th>
<th> Eb(Mi b) </th>
<th> Ab(La b) </th>
<th> Db(Re b) </th>
<th> Gb(Sol b) </th>
<th> B(Si) </th>
<th> E(Mi) </th>
<th> A(La) </th>
<th> D(Re) </th>
<th> G(Sol) </th>
<th> C(Do) </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>


<h3>SumUp Circles and Key Signatures</h3>

<p>We can sumup everything in the following representation (from wikipedia)</p>

<p>This image contains all the major and relative minor scales witht the corresponding key signatures (for flat and sharp).
If we read it clockwise we see the circle of 5ths and if we read it counter-clockwise the circle of 4ths.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg" alt="Circle of 5ths" /></p>

<h2>More on Scales</h2>

<p>Refreshing the definition of <strong>Music Scale</strong></p>

<p>Is an ordered increasing in frequency sequence of notes.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music)" title="Music Scale">Music Scale</a> definition on wikipedia</p>

<h3>Major Scale</h3>

<p>We have defined the major scale as a sequence that follows:</p>

<pre><code>TTSTTTS
</code></pre>

<p>Where:</p>

<pre><code>T = Tone
S = Semitone
</code></pre>

<h3>Minor Scales</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen the Natural minor scale, but there are others, lets see:</p>

<p>A complete article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale" title="minor scales">minor scales</a> on Wikipedia</p>

<h4>Natural Minor Scale</h4>

<p>We have defined the natural minor as a sequence that follows:</p>

<pre><code>TSTTSTT
</code></pre>

<h4>Harmonic Minor Scale</h4>

<p>In the Natural Minor Scale there is a <strong>tone</strong> between the <strong>7th</strong> (the last note of the sequence before the tonic) and the <strong>tonic</strong>. This is, the 7th is a <strong>minor 7th</strong>.</p>

<p>But we name the <strong>major 7th</strong> as the <strong>leading tone</strong>, that is, the note that leads to the <strong>tone</strong>. For this harmonic reason, we modify the Natural Minor Scale on the end and create the <strong>Harmonic Minor Scale</strong> as:</p>

<pre><code>TSTTS(T+S)S
</code></pre>

<h4>Melodic Minor Scale</h4>

<p>Singing the Harmonic Minor Scale is difficult, specially because of the Tone and a half, so there was another minor scale created to create an easier to sing melody, and this takes the form:</p>

<pre><code>TSTTTTS
</code></pre>

<p>We can see all three scales in the following example:</p>

			Lesson 1 Fundamentals of Music Theory - Introduction to Chords</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I listen to a beautiful piece of music, while my body feels the pleaszure of it, my minds tries to find different things.
Among them, how to be able to play it with my guitar and sing it.</p>

<p>For playing it with the guitar I usually need to know the chords that are ther.</p>

<p>So, what are chords?</p>

<h2>Chords</h2>

<p>So, for what I see and I do, I could say that:</p>

<p>A <strong>chord</strong> is a defined set of notes played at the same time.</p>

<p>So, for defining and naming them, it&rsquo;ll be good to have a way to do it with consistency and being able to everybody name and build chords in the same way.</p>

<p>For this, let&rsquo;s go back to the <strong>C (Do) Major Scale</strong> where we started basing our study.</p>

<h3>Let&rsquo;s repeat the <strong>C Major Scale</strong>:</h3>

<pre><code>Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do -&gt; Names - Latin speaking countries
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do -&gt; Solfege sylabs
C  D  E  F  G   A  B  C  -&gt; Names -Saxon countries
1  2  3  4  5   6  7  1  -&gt; Scales degrees
</code></pre>

<p>Lets look at a type of chords with 3 notes, and as they have 3 notes, we will call them <strong>triads</strong>.</p>

<p>If we simultaneourly play the <strong>Tonic</strong> and the <strong>5th</strong> we can hear a nice consonance.</p>

<p>Then we can take the <strong>3rd</strong> (major and minor 3rd) and play it with the tonic, it also sounds good.</p>

<p>Not lets form two sets, one with <strong>(Tonic, 3rd, 5th)</strong> and other: <strong>(Tonic, min 3rd, 5th )</strong></p>

<p>If we play them we can listen to a small difference, we will call the first one <strong>Major triad</strong> and the second one <strong>Minor triad</strong></p>

<p>and for the name of the chord we will use, as with the scales, the <strong>Tonic</strong>, that is, the first note.</p>

<p>So the following example will be to form the <strong>C major</strong> and <strong>C minor</strong> chords:</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s all for chords today.</p>

			Last Week Sumup</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This blog is about the Lean way to learn music. Lean means trying to reduce waste as much as possible, and this is an iterative process.
So I&rsquo;m learning while doing, and the idea is to do the shortest possible iterations and realize when to change directions.</p>

<p>For sure there will be some waste, waste of time mainly. Waste of words for sure. The idea is to learn and to improve while doing. But always, being able to progress.</p>

<p>There is something great about writing down things, all progress (or noon-progress) gets documented,
and even if I think that this little details do not matter, I&rsquo;ve realized that I do much
more when I have the obligation to write down the results and the plan was clear.</p>

<p>This week I did several things, but I still have a lot to learn in how to handle and organize all TODO list. I usually get distracted by something and keep on doing something that needs doing, but it&rsquo;s not necessarily the best order.</p>

<h2>1. What I did about Education &ndash; I started two different online courses:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Developing Your Musicianship &ndash; Cursera &ndash; Berklee College of Music &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002">https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002</a></li>
<li>Fundamentals of Music Theory &ndash; Cursera &ndash; University of Edinburg &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001">https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001</a></li>
</ol>


<p>The first one, is really practical and I love the way it&rsquo;s taught. Althogh I found it a bit difficult (and redundant, after writing down the first one) to write down in blog posts the lessons. I&rsquo;m trying to get the grip on a couple of ideas to make online tools to help practicing and learning the concepts easier.</p>

<p>The second one is really nice, as the title says, it&rsquo;s about theory, so I found it easier to be able to write down things.</p>

<h3>About how I managed the learning this week</h3>

<p>What I did well:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve actually made the first week progress for both courses, and I&rsquo;ve started with the second week</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve started writing down the progress in blog posts, even if this took time, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot</li>
<li>I started writing the posts when I was watching the videos, this helped me organize better the ideas and fix them better in my head</li>
<li>While writing down I realized that for the course <strong>Developing Your Musicianship</strong> I hadn&rsquo;t too much to write down, but instead I had to practice</li>
</ul>


<p>What I&rsquo;ve should have done better</p>

<ul>
<li>I did too many lessons in a row, this hindered my ability to write down things and organize them well in my head. At the end I had to watch some videos again and I&rsquo;m still missing one blog post (about chords)</li>
<li>I did not practice 15 minutes every day. Some days I practiced a couple of hours, while 1 day I didn&rsquo;t practice at all, one I didn&rsquo;t practice enough because I got distracted by a phone call and after that distracted by other thing. I have to be more rigorous about the practice.</li>
<li>One day I didn&rsquo;t started slow and easy and I made a bad movement, I felt pain and had to stop the practice for the day.</li>
</ul>


<h2>2. What I did about Services &ndash; I found a bug in musicpaste.com</h2>

<p><a href="http://musicpaste.com" title="MusicPaste">MusicPaste</a> is a free online service for writing, sharing and embedding music sheets.</p>

<p>It was born as something for myself but then I thought &ldquo;Maybe other people need it too!&rdquo;.
So I decided to make it a free service for other people to use it if they need it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found a problem in the application (yesterday actually), I&rsquo;ve located it and now I&rsquo;m correcting it. It&rsquo;s one of the priorities of the following week.</p>

<h3>About how I managed the learning this week</h3>

<p>What I did well:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have been actively using the site for creating the music sheets for <strong>this</strong> blog</li>
<li>I just saw a problem and started tackling it</li>
</ul>


<p>What I should have done better:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a huge TODO list for this site (many small details), I should have done one simple point.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t write down the ideas I got for other practice and learning tools.</li>
</ul>


<h2>3. What I did about Instruments &ndash; I bought a digital piano</h2>

<p>YES! It should be arriving next week!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled and anxious, and &hellip; I just want it NOW!</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next</h2>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve written down my sumup, now the important part that follows, the <strong>ACTIONS</strong> to take for next week.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<ul>
<li>Keep on doing the lessons</li>
<li>Watch one or two videos (if they seem to be really related) and write a blog post for each on the theory</li>
<li>Start writing down the exercises and drills that I do for the Musicianship course and post them. Do this after each video where practice is involved</li>
<li>Warm-up better before starting to play</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Success measures:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Do all the lessons of week 2 of both courses</li>
<li>Write posts that include all the theory of both courses up to the end of lesson 2</li>
<li>Having practiced 15 minutes every day (playing for fun doesn&rsquo;t count)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Services</h3>

<ul>
<li>Write down detailed ideas about tools that I have (for example the ear training tool and the scale practice tool I have in mind)</li>
<li>Make one improvement to <a href="http://musicpaste.com" title="MusicPaste">MusicPaste</a>. The priority fix the bug.</li>
<li>Decide one and only one new tool to start programming it. Write down the action plan for it.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Success measures:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Having in paper (or in the computer) a detail of the tools (at least ear training and scale practice tools)</li>
<li>Having a decition and action plan written down for which tool to start working on next</li>
<li>Having fixed the problem I found in musicpaste, as extra, having added (or started) working on another feature on the TODO list</li>
</ul>

			Lesson 1 - Fundamentals of Music Theory - More on Scales</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are three basic concepts to take from this lesson:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is a <strong>mode</strong></li>
<li>The definition of <strong>natural minor scale</strong></li>
<li>The definition of a <strong>relative minor</strong></li>
</ol>


<h2>Mode</h2>

<p>Modes is something I can&rsquo;t seem to grasp correctly, anyway, I&rsquo;ll give it a try, and hopefully I&rsquo;ll get to understand it better.</p>

<p>For the practical point of view for what I can get for the moment:</p>

<pre><code>A musical mode is simply a variation from where we start playing the sequence of notes.
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>Another way to name the scales
</code></pre>

<p>Reading the simple definition of <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode" title="Mode">Mode</a> in Wikipedia I can grasp what I stated before.</p>

<p>A more detailed explanation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)" title="Mode">Mode</a> in Wikipedia</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done an exaustive list of all the modes (with the TAB in case of need) here:</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Natural Minor Scale</h2>

<p>Lets choose arbitrarily one sequence of notes from the modes before.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s play in the keyboard all the white keys from <strong>A(La)</strong> to the next <strong>A(La)</strong> key.</p>

<iframe src="http://musicpaste.com/musicapp/embed_score/i2jotPALdxdAzbcHPFGCf7/" width="640px" height="380px"> <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> </iframe>


<p></p>

<h2>Relative Minor</h2>

<p>If now we see the relationships between the notes in the A(La) Natural Minor Scale, we will notice the following pattern of Tones and Semitones:</p>

<pre><code>TSTTSTT
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that is only a transposition of the C (Do) Major Scale: TTSTTTS</p>

<p>We decide (just because we want to) call this two scales <strong>relatives</strong></p>

			Lesson 1 - Fundamentals of Music Theory - Octaves</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>From Pythagoras to the modern days, music has evolved, transformed and has become what is today.</p>

<p>Sounds where studied in different ways, music notation evolved, and also the definition of the notes.</p>

<p>Even if scales will be defined in later. Modern music is  studied in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale" title="Diatonic Scale">diatonic scale</a>
and is the one I&rsquo;m interested in using.</p>

<p>Relationships between notes are important, and here we study</p>

<p>We are going to look at vertical distances between notes</p>

<h2>Octaves</h2>

<p><strong>8 whole notes</strong>
An octave actually contains 12 notes.</p>

<p>If we use an instrument, we will be able to notice that every octave is &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; when studying (or listening) the relationships between the notes inside each octave.</p>

<p>And there is a relationship also between octaves. If we divide the frequency of the Nth note in the highest octave by the frequency of the Nth note of the lowest octave, it will always result in an integer.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take as one example is <strong>La</strong> 440Hz</p>

<pre><code>Going lower than 440Hz: **La** also exist in 220Hz, 110Hz, 55Hz

Going higher than **La** 440Hz we have 880Hz, 1760Hz, 3520Hz, etc
</code></pre>

<h2>Distances</h2>

<h3>Semitone:</h3>

<pre><code>Smallest working distance we can have between 2 notes.

Distance between two consecutive notes
</code></pre>

<p>In the diatonic scale we have 12 notes, the minimum distance is called <strong>semitone</strong></p>

<h3>Tone:</h3>

<pre><code>Distance  of 2 semitones
</code></pre>

<h2>Intervals:</h2>

<ul>
<li>2nd: 2 semitones C (Do) &ndash;> D (Re)</li>
<li>3rd: 4 semitones C (Do) &ndash;> E (Mi)</li>
<li>4th: 5 semitones C (Do) &ndash;> F (Fa)</li>
<li>5th: 7 semitones C (Do) &ndash;> G (Sol)</li>
<li>6th: 9 semitones C (Do) &ndash;> A (La)</li>
<li>7th: 11 semitones C (Do) &ndash;>  B (Si)</li>
<li>Octave: 12  semitones C (Do)&ndash;> C (Do) of next octave</li>
</ul>

</iframe>


<p></p>

<h2>Scale:</h2>

<p>The way I see an scale is an ordered and defined sequence of different notes.
The order is from lower to higher pitch</p>

<p>We can say that is the <strong>path</strong> trough an octave</p>

<p>For example, the C Major Scale as we read below.</p>

<h2>C Major Scale</h2>

<p>The nice thing about creating something, is that you get to name it the way you want.
So, lets imagine that we are the creators of C Major Scale, we decided how to define it and we named it as <strong>C Major Scale</strong> or equivalently <strong>Do Major Scale</strong></p>

<p>We take our piano (imagine you have a piano, use yours, or use one online), and we find any  <strong>C (Do)</strong></p>

<p>Then from that note, we play all the white keys up to the next <strong>C (Do)</strong></p>

<p>And we decide that we will call this scale the <strong>C (Do) Major Scale</strong>:</p>

</iframe>


<p>So now we have this awesome scale, with a name.</p>

<p>The most important thing to note, is that our ear cares a lot about the relationships between notes, so lets see this scale:</p>

<p>There are white keys notes that have a black key in between, and there are other white keys that dont.</p>

<p>As we said before, the minimum interval between two notes is a <strong>semitone</strong>.</p>

<p>We assign a the <strong>T</strong> to a Tone interval and the <strong>S</strong> to a Semitone interval</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s analyze the  <strong>C (Do) Major Scale</strong></p>

<p>We can see that the pattern formed is: <strong>TTSTTTS</strong></p>

<p>So now we decide to call <strong>ANY</strong> scale that contains this tone and semitone pattern the <strong>Major Scale</strong> and as we did with the  <strong>C (Do) Major Scale</strong> we will name the scale with the first note, so if we start from <strong>D</strong> and we follow the same pattern, we will call it the  <strong>D (Re) Major Scale</strong>.</p>

<p>Another definition: The <strong>TONIC</strong> is the note that gives the scale the name.</p>

<p>That is all for the sumup of this lesson. Next post will be more about scales.</p>

			Lesson 1 - Fundamentals of Music Theory - Musical Notes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Music Notes</h1>

<p>When I think about a music note my mind creates a sound that I can recognize, and then, when I find it in my guitar I can put a name on it to tell somebody else what note I have sounding in my head.</p>

<p>So for the practical point of view of how I see it:</p>

<p>A <strong>music note</strong> is a concept that links</p>

<pre><code>1. A Pitch
2. A Name
</code></pre>

<p>A more formal definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note" title="Music Note">Music Note</a> in Wikipedia</p>

<h2>Sound</h2>

<p>Definition:</p>

<pre><code>For the practical point of view a sound is anyhing that we can listen to.
</code></pre>

<p>A more formal definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound" title="Sound">Sound</a> in Wikipedia</p>

<p>There is one main characteristic of sound is the idea that is <strong>low</strong> or <strong>high</strong></p>

<p>A sound can be <strong>singable</strong> if we (anyone) manage(s) to sing it or <strong>not singable</strong> otherwise. But going further to the definition. Singable means that we can identify and reproduce it, while not singable means that we have a rough idea of its <strong>high</strong> or <strong>low</strong> quality but not able to actually identify it with a single note.</p>

<h2>Pitch</h2>

<p>Is a quality of sound that allows us to identify and order it.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)" title="Pitch">Pitch</a> in Wikipedia</p>

<h2>Naming the notes</h2>

<p>For naming the notes, there is the need to have a notation that allows us to reproduce the same idea with the same symbols.</p>

<p>This way, we introduce the <strong>stave</strong> that allows us to do it.</p>

<h3>Stave</h3>

<pre><code>5 lines and 4 spaces in between
</code></pre>

<p>The lines in the Stave means nothing without knowing how to start naming the notes.</p>

<p>For this naming there are the <strong>clefs</strong> that indicates that a certain line corresponds to a certain note.</p>

<p>For exemple, the <strong>G clef</strong> also called <strong>Trebble Clef</strong></p>

<p>An example, with also the TAB style below (for guitar players)</p>

  <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>
</iframe>


<p>This example corresponds to the following names:</p>

<pre><code>Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do -&gt; Names - Latin speaking countries
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do -&gt; Solfege sylabs
C  D  E  F  G   A  B  C  -&gt; Names -Saxon countries
1  2  3  4  5   6  7  1  -&gt; Scales degrees
</code></pre>

<p>When a note is in a place where there are no lines around (above or below the 5 lines), we write a small line called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger_line" title="Ledger Line">ledger line</a>.</p>

<p>For the purpose of</p>

<h3>Reading &ndash; mnemotechnics</h3>

<p>Mnemotechnics for the lines:
EGBDF &ndash; Every Good Boy Deserves Food</p>

<p>Pnemotechnics for the spaces:
FACE &ndash; face</p>

<p>Here you can see an actual example:</p>

			Lesson 1 - Developing Your Musicianship - Important Definitions</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As writing helps me put ideas in order. I&rsquo;ll try to write a post for each lesson.
So here there is the first post of a series that will make it possible for me to track the progress made.</p>

<p>I hope is also useful for you too!</p>

<p>This series of post is dedicated to write down what I get from the online courses.</p>

<h1>Important Definitions</h1>

<h2>Harmony</h2>

<p>The study of chords, scales and melodies</p>

<p>Harmony study inclues the analysis of chords progressions to show important relationships between chords and the key a song is in.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony" title="Harmony">Harmony</a> definition in Wikipedia</p>

<h2>Ear training</h2>

<p>Identifying what your ear hears</p>

<p>Ear training makes the connections between your musical mind, your ears, the sound around you, music notation and your instrument.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_training" title="Ear Training">Ear Training</a> definition in Wikipedia</p>

<h2>We start now</h2>

<p>Everything we do comes or can be related to the <strong>C Major Scale</strong></p>

<pre><code>Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do -&gt; Names - Latin speaking countries
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do -&gt; Solfege sylabs
C  D  E  F  G   A  B  C  -&gt; Names -Saxon countries
1  2  3  4  5   6  7  1  -&gt; Scales degrees

<h3>Exercise:</h3>

<pre><code>Play it while singing - 4 times:
1,2 - Naming (Latin and Saxon names)
3 - singing the solfege sylabs
4 - singing the scales degrees
</code></pre>

<h2>Interval</h2>

<p>Distance between two notes</p>

			Third Challenge - Getting Into Music</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Getting into music.</h1>

<p>Learning is a tough, long, wonderful process.</p>

<p>There is a magic, wonderful and amazing excitement and emotion when we fulfill something.
And that magic can only be felt if and only if, we spent our time perfecting for that moment.</p>

<p>There is no (actual) pleasure in things that come so easy to us, but the wonderful emotion that pours from us when we succeed at something comples, it makes it all.</p>

<p>That is why people climb mountains, and then sits at the top, looking at everything. I&rsquo;ve done it, and there are no words to describe the feeling.</p>

<p>What about music?</p>

<p>Well, every time I manage to make a song sound nice enough, I feel an enourmous pleasure.</p>

<p>One of my goals is to be able to play, compose and learn music, beter and faster.</p>

<p>For this, I think that I should learn music theory, and as learning it alone is difficult, and I know I need a guide, I subscribed at the courses here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Developing Your Musicianship &ndash; Cursera &ndash; Berklee College of Music &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002">https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002</a></li>
<li>Fundamentals of Music Theory &ndash; Cursera &ndash; University of Edinburg &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001">https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001</a></li>
</ol>


<p>The courses are already started, but then there is a goal and the challenge is a medium term one:</p>

<pre><code>**Finish both courses, with all the drills completed**
</code></pre>

<p>The short term goals are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Finish (at least) one lesson each week</li>
<li>Practice aplying the theory with the instrument at least 15 minutes every day</li>
</ol>
