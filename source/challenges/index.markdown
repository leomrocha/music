#Challenges - How will I 

##Music: Passion & Love.

That sounds beautiful, but for achieving something, there must be a process, and habit, and discipline when we are tired.

So, I proposed to myself, dividing the process in weekly and monthly challenges.

####Lets define a challenge in the following way:

A challenge is a simple and defined goal, that can be measured for success or failure.

A challenge can be:

 * Play every day 10 times the **C Maj** scale
 * Play  **C Maj** scale with max 5% deviation error an no notes error on 10 repetitions with tempo = 120 BPM.
 
A challenge is not:

 * Learn **C Maj** scale. -> this is not easily measured.
 * Play  **C Maj** scale on tempo.

After the end of every challenge period, there should be a sumup of the results, the things to improve and the lessons learned.

There will be different kind of challenges, that can include:

 * Music Instrument Practice (guitar, piano, ukulele, singing, etc)
 * Music tempo practice
 * Music Theory
 * Application (tools) development (coding, design, a new game, etc)
 * Blog setup (things that need to be done to improve and keep the blog working)
 * Social (contacting X number of people or groups of people interested in learning music)
 * ... Other challenges

The idea is that challenges should be short to keep the motivation, so the idea
The challenges can be:
    
    1. Weekly
    2. Monthly (for example, a monthly goal that can be partitioned in weekly challenges)
    3. Special (for example, entering a contest, or traveling to a summer school, or any other non  covered)
