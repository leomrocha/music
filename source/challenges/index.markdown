#Challenges


**Intelligence is nothing without studying and actually using it**

**Talent can not develop without practice**

**There are no shurtcuts. There is no success without constant work**

##Music: Passion & Love.

**Passion & Love** sounds beautiful, but for achieving something, there must be a process and habit, and discipline.

The thought of having soooo much to learn, that is impossible to climb that tall unknown learning wall of a difficult language seems to overwhelm my thoughts, and in consequence, I do nothing in frustration.

And trying to accomplish that lead me to start this blog.

The idea of Lean, comes from the lean processes, the agile software ideas and the Lean Startup community.
The idea is to minimize waste, waste in form of time, waste in form of money. The idea is to see fast if things are working.

Also, there is the need of some motivation to be able to follow, that is some reason to do it. Public commitment and accountability are some strong motivators.

For this, and all the things 

So, I propose dividing the process in small, measurable challenges.

###Challenge definition

Lets define a challenge is a simple, short and defined goal, that can be measured for success or failure.
This goal must be achievable in a short and defined period of time (a week), if the goal is too big for a week, it should be cutted into small sub-challenges that are achievable in one week.

A challenge can be:

 * Play every day 10 times the **C Maj** scale
 * Play **C Maj** scale with max 5% deviation error an no notes error on 10 repetitions with tempo = 120 BPM.
 
A challenge is not (because is not defined how to measure them):

 * Learn **C Maj** scale.
 * Play  **C Maj** scale on tempo.

After the end of every challenge period, there should be a sumup of the results, the things to improve and the lessons learned.

### Challenge periods
The idea is that challenges should be short to keep the motivation, so the idea
The challenges can be:
    
    1. Weekly
    2. Monthly (for example, a monthly goal that can be partitioned in weekly challenges)
    3. Special (for example, entering a contest, or traveling to a summer school, or any other non  covered)

### Types of Challenges:

There will be different kind of challenges, that can include:

 * Music Instrument Practice (guitar, piano, ukulele, singing, etc)
 * Music tempo practice
 * Music Theory
 * Application (tools) development (coding, design, a new game, etc)
 * Blog setup (things that need to be done to improve and keep the blog working)
 * Social (contacting X number of people or groups of people interested in learning music)
 * ... Other challenges

### Evaluation points:

Every challenge should be evaluated to see:

 1. If it was completed. If couldn't, then why.
 2. If the challenge was too big, too small or just right
 3. If it was useful
 4. If it was well defined.
 5. If there was work done every day to achieve it
 6. The time it took during the week.
