#Why this blog?

We feel and dance with music,
We sing and jump with music,
We cry and smile with music,
We love with music

Can you imagine a world without music? .... Neither can I.

I want to be able to create and play any kind of music, and that will take time.

And, if it is not enough, I love so much music, and I've struggled learning for the last few years.
For sure I've improved, but I'm not nearly close where I want to be.
There is so much to learn, so much to do.

So, for pushing myself to do that, I've created this blog. 
Also, beacause I want to inspire and help others to do the same.

That's why, I'll be creating and releasing different online tools that will help me and others to create, share and learn music.
As a Computer Engineer, I can (and have started to) create online tools for educational purposes. I'll be putting them online as I feel they are ready.

Everything I'll be doing, will be for me to be able to use it, that is why, the tools should be helpful. 
There is at least one person that needs them.

The blog will start only in English, but I hope, in due time, to port it too to French and Spanish.



And contact me if you want to share or talk.
Please contact me about anything related to the learning methods and tools.

For example:

 * Any of my tools suits you
 * You need some modification
 * you need a tool that I don't have and you think to have the good idea
 * you find another one that is good for you
 * ... other reasons

***Enjoy! Play, create and LOVE music.***

Best,

Leo
