We are going to look at vertical distances between notes

## Octaves

**8 whole notes**
An octave actually contains 12 notes.

## Distances

###Semitone:
    Smallest working distance we can have between 2 notes.
    
    Distance between two consecutive notes
    
###Tone:
    Distance between 
    
##Intervals:

2nd: 

3rd:

4th

5th:

6th: 

7th: C - B

### Exercise:
Name all the intervals
Write down all the intervals beggining from every note

TODO redo all 
  TODO Challenge:
  Game that generates intervals and I have to evaluate them!



## Scale:

Path trough an octave

## C Major Scale

TODO all about the C maj scale

The important thing is the relationship between the notes, and the difference between tones and semitones

Tone = T
Semitone = S

The pattern TTSTTTS makes the scale sound like it sounds. 
It gives the quality of this scale.

The **TONIC** is the note that gives the scale the name.

We will call it **Major Scale**

As the first note on this scale is **C** we will call this scale: **C Major Scale**

Diatonic - dia == between 
Diatonic Scale: 5 tones and 2 semitones

A scale helps to make music!!

So, give a **C Major** music example


## Common practice - music

Western music from 16 to 19 century

applies to a lot of music and we will focus here:
