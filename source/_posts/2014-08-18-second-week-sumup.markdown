#How am I doing? - Second week

After working now for 2 weeks on this project, I've realized that one of the most difficult things is to keep a discipline.

The first week was a **success**, putting online the musicpaste.com service.

For the second week, putting all the other things online, I realised one thing:
**The goal was not specific enough.** And that, made it difficult.

Also, there where the mandatory parts of the sites that takes time but adds no value: the terms and conditions and all the legal points that must be fulfilled to comply with EU regulations (I live in France).

Also, while I'm starting at learning music theory, I've noticed that the lack of structure is just so difficult.

So, now I've decided a few things:
 1. I will try to set better goals for better understanding
 2. I will be taking online courses from Cursera and Udacity
 
 
I'll explain more of this goals in specific blog posts.
