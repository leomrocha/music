### Type: Weekly Challenge:

Create and put online a tool that allows to create and play the newly created music sheets, scores and TABs.

### Why?

All things start to be in place in this blog, and the first challenge is to build an online tool that allows people (everyone) to write music notation, and play it. Play it with diferent types of sounds.

###Â The success measures are:

 * The tool is online
 * The tool is usable by everyone
 * Music notation (TABs, scores) are supported
 * The tool allows to embed the created scores into other web pages and blogs (YES, this is for all of you)
 
 
### Tools I'll be using:

For this, I will integrate tools from:
    
 * MIDI.js
 * Vexflow
 * Vextab
 * AngularJS
 * DjangoProject
