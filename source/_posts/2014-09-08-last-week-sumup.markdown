**There is no magic, all progress comes from constant work and deep understanding**

Music is a way of living, and as always in my life, any activity affects (in a possitive way) the rest of my life.

Last week I realized something about this path, is not only about music, but is about **life**.

And one of the main points, one of the things that makes life easier, is creating habits.

This week I started creating the habit of playing piano, at least a small drill, when I wake up, after the breakfast and when I come back from work. 

# And now, the weekly SumUp


##Study

This second week I got really turned off by the 
[**Theory Lessons**](https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001/lecture)
 too much theory, too *"talked"* everything and not enough examples.

But, the PDF from the course contains most of the information needed to understand the theory. The rest, I read about in Wikipedia, here some articles that I read:


 * [Rythm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm)
 * [Tuplet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuplet)
 * [Duration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duration_%28music%29)
 * [Duration Series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duration_series)
 * [Unequal Notes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_in%C3%A9gales)
 * [Notes Values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_value)
 * [Ornament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornament_%28music%29)

This actually let me think that I should not write the post about it. I should have anyways.

I practiced a bit with the guitar, but with a pick and also with the thumbpick. It's really frustrating to play now that I've cutted my fingernails to be able to play and learn piano. I have to get used to playing without fingernails.

I analyzed 
[Czerny Op.599 - drill 1 ](http://leomrocha.github.io/music/blog/2014/09/07/studying-piano-czerny-op-dot-599-1/)
And practiced creating small drills that would allow me to learn the lesson.

## Applications
I wrote the whole [WMPK](leomrocha.github.io/wmpk) (Web MIDI Piano Keyboard) site (instead of just starting it).

The MIDI input interface is working great with Chrome and Chromium. I have some other things I want to add to it.

It also added sound synthesis with sound fonts from [MIDI.js](http://mudcu.be/midi-js/)

Concerning [MusicPaste](musicpaste.com) I fixed some issues and added a bit more about the fretboard support, but I havent yet finished so I did not update the website.


### Study Evaluation

**Success measures:**

 * Do all the lessons of week 3 of both courses  -> **DONE**
 * Write posts that include all the theory of both courses up to the end of lesson 3  -> **NOT DONE**
 * Write down at least 2 drills for piano and 2 for guitar.  -> **Yes for piano, no for guitar**
 * Having practiced 15 minutes every day (playing for fun doesn't count)  -> **DONE**


### Writing Applications Evaluation

**Success measures:**

 * Having a simple AngularJS web page that can read and show on screen the midi input from the piano and can send midi instructions to the piano.  -> **DONE ++**
 * Having added (or started if it's complex) one feature in the TODO list  -> **DONE**

## What's next

So, I've written down my sumup, now the important part that follows, the **ACTIONS** to take for next week.

### Education

 * Keep on doing the lessons
 * Watch one or two videos (if they seem to be related) and write a blog post for each on the theory
 * Start writing down the exercises and drills that I do for the Musicianship course and post them. Do this after each video where practice is involved.
 * Warm-up better before starting to play
 

**Success measures:**

 * Do all the lessons of week 3 of both courses
 * Write posts that include all the theory of both courses up to the end of lesson 3
 * Write down at least 2 drills for piano and 2 for guitar.
 * Having practiced 15 minutes every day (playing for fun doesn't count)
 
### Services

 * Define and start the next application
 * Continue the Freatboard support for [MusicPaste](http://musicpaste.com "MusicPaste").
 
**Success measures:**

 * Having defined the new application
 * Having a simple AngularJS web page that can do one basic feature of the new application
 * Having at least support for freatboard edition on musicpaste.com on local server
