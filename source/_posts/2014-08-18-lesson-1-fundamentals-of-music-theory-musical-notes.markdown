# Music Notes

## Sound

Definition:

    For the practical point of view a sound is anyhing that we can listen to.


A more formal definition of [Sound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound "Sound") in Wikipedia

There is one main characteristic of sound is the idea that is **low** or **high**

A sound can be **singable** if we (anyone) manage(s) to sing it or **not singable** otherwise. But going further to the definition. Singable means that we can identify and reproduce it, while not singable means that we have a rough idea of its **high** or **low** quality but not able to actually identify it with a single note.

## Pitch

Is a quality of sound that allows us to identify and order it.

[Pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music) "Pitch") in Wikipedia


##Naming the notes

For naming the notes, there is the need to have a notation that allows us to reproduce the same idea with the same symbols.

This way, we introduce the **stave** that allows us to do it.

###Stave

    5 lines and 4 spaces in between
    


The lines in the Stave means nothing without knowing how to start naming the notes.

For this naming there are the **clefs** that indicates that a certain line corresponds to a certain note.


For exemple, the **G clef** also called **Trebble Clef**

An example, with also the TAB style below (for guitar players)

This example corresponds to the following names:

    Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do -> Names - Latin speaking countries
    Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do -> Solfege sylabs
    C  D  E  F  G   A  B  C  -> Names -Saxon countries
    1  2  3  4  5   6  7  1  -> Scales degrees


When a note is in a place where there are no lines around (above or below the 5 lines), we write a small line called [ledger line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger_line "Ledger Line").

For the purpose of 
###Reading - mnemotechnics
