##Naming the notes
For naming the notes, there is the need to 

Stave

Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si -> Latin speaking countries
C  D  E  F  G   A  B -> Saxon countries
1  2  3  4  5   6  7

and relationships with the stave and the clefs
(ledgeline)?? (check if the name is right, for the line that has to be added when no line of the stave transverses it

G clef === Trebble Clef
