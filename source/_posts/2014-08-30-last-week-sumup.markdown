I'm making this posts so I can learn more and better, and this week has been quite interesting.

I'm still too impulsive and I have to improve my disciplineon on music.
I'm used to playing and joking with my guitar, but discipline to actually study is not my strongest point.


My piano arrived Thursday night, and after that I was compeltely distracted with trying things.

I tested the USB-MIDI interface, is working great, and I'm trying to find out how to build something that will help me in my learning path with it now. It will be web and I hope will be useful for other people too.

I didn't feel like doing one post for video was right in this case, so I wrote onl one for the things I believe are the most importants of this lesson.

The second week of taking lessons was really interesting, I've made lots of progress on my music just in this two weeks that I am really motivated to keep studying.
