I'm making this posts so I can learn more and better, and this week has been quite interesting.

The word **lean** in the blog theme is not because it should be easy, or fast, or no waste. But because the goal is to minimize the non-useful things, processes and be able to iterate **fast** and discard things that are not working.

What I've found out this week is that is not necesary the best idea to write a blog post per video in the lessons.

The second week of taking lessons was really interesting, I've made lots of progress on my music just in this two weeks that I am really motivated to keep on studying.

I'm still too impulsive and I have to improve my discipline with music.
I'm used to playingwith my guitar, but discipline to actually study music is not my strongest point.

My new piano arrived Thursday night, and after that I was compeltely distracted with trying things, reading the manual, connecting it to the computer, etc. Luckily there are two friends at home now and both play piano well, so I've been able to listen to nice things. 

I tried playing some things. I was amazed how much could I really understand and do! I was waiting for not being able to do anything at all, but at least I've been able to play a couple of melodies by ear, and start playing the first exercise of one of Czerny's piano methods!

I tested the USB-MIDI interface, is working great, and I'm trying to find out how to build something that will help me in my learning path with it now. It will be web and I hope will be useful for other people too.


So, going to last week's goals:

**Last week goals:**

 * Do all the lessons of week 2 of both courses -> DONE
 * Write posts that include all the theory of both courses up to the end of lesson 2 -> DONE (in a different way that the planned)
 * Having practiced 15 minutes every day (playing for fun doesn't count) -> MMMM, I've practiced but not enough.
 
 * Having in paper (or in the computer) a detail of the tools (at least ear training and scale practice tools) -> plan changed, will do something more basic and easier first.
 * Having a decition and action plan written down for which tool to start working on next -> Changed, will create a web version of VMPK, but with synesthesia and be able to extend it for the learning tools later.
 * Having fixed the problem I found in musicpaste, as extra, having added (or started) working on another feature on the TODO list -> DONE, the fix. No extra



## What's next

So, I've written down my sumup, now the important part that follows, the **ACTIONS** to take for next week.

### Education

 * Keep on doing the lessons
 * Watch one or two videos (if they seem to be related) and write a blog post for each on the theory
 * Start writing down the exercises and drills that I do for the Musicianship course and post them. Do this after each video where practice is involved.
 * Warm-up better before starting to play
 

**Success measures:**

 * Do all the lessons of week 3 of both courses
 * Write posts that include all the theory of both courses up to the end of lesson 3
 * Write down at least 2 drills for piano and 2 for guitar.
 * Having practiced 15 minutes every day (playing for fun doesn't count)
 
### Services

 * Start the WMPK page (VMPK web port for Chrome)
 * Make one improvement to [MusicPaste](http://musicpaste.com "MusicPaste").
 
**Success measures:**

 * Having a simple AngularJS web page that can read and show on screen the midi input from the piano and can send midi instructions to the piano.
 * Having added (or started if it's complex) one feature in the TODO list
