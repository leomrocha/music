#Getting into music.

Learning is a tough, long, wonderful process.

There is a magic, wonderful and amazing excitement and emotion when we fulfill something.
And that magic can only be felt if and only if, we spent our time perfecting for that moment.

There is no (actual) pleasure in things that come so easy to us, but the wonderful emotion that pours from us when we succeed at something comples, it makes it all.

That is why people climb mountains, and then sits at the top, looking at everything. I've done it, and there are no words to describe the feeling.

What about music?

Well, every time I manage to make a song sound nice enough, I feel an enourmous pleasure.

One of my goals is to be able to play, compose and learn music, beter and faster.

For this, I think that I should learn music theory, and as learning it alone is difficult, and I know I need a guide, I subscribed at the courses here:

 1. Developing Your Musicianship - Cursera - Berklee College of Music - https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002
 2. Fundamentals of Music Theory - Cursera - University of Edinburg - https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001
 

The courses are already started, but then there is a goal and the challenge is a medium term one:

    
    **Finish both courses, with all the drills completed**

The short term goals are:

 1. Finish (at least) one lesson each week
 2. Practice aplying the theory with the instrument at least 15 minutes every day
