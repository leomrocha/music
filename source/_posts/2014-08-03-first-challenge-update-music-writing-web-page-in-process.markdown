##Writing and sharing music online

That was the latest challenge. And the success of mesure where the following:

 * The tool is online -> CHECK
 * The tool is usable by everyone -> CHECK
 * Music notation (TABs, scores) are supported -> CHECK
 * The tool allows to embed the created scores into other web pages and blogs (YES, this is for all of you) -> CHECK
 
All checked!! First week goes with a success!

I want to be able to write, and use this tool to empower others and myself to create, share and study music.

That is why I'm creating this tools.

####So, here a working sample of it:
