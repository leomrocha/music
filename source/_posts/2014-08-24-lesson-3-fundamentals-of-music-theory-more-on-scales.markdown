There are three basic concepts to take from this lesson: 

 1. What is a **mode**
 2. The definition of **natural minor scale**
 3. The definition of a **relative minor**


##Mode

Modes is something I can't seem to grasp correctly, anyway, I'll give it a try, and hopefully I'll get to understand it better.

For the practical point of view for what I can get for the moment:
 
    A musical mode is simply a variation from where we start playing the sequence of notes.
    
or

    Another way to name the scales
    

Reading the simple definition of [Mode](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode "Mode") in Wikipedia I can grasp what I stated before.

A more detailed explanation of [Mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music\) "Mode") in Wikipedia



I've done an exaustive list of all the modes (with the TAB in case of need) here:

##Natural Minor Scale

Lets choose arbitrarily one sequence of notes from the modes before.

Let's play in the keyboard all the white keys from **A(La)** to the next **A(La)** key.

##Relative Minor

If now we see the relationships between the notes in the A(La) Natural Minor Scale, we will notice the following pattern of Tones and Semitones:

    TSTTSTT

We can see that is only a transposition of the C (Do) Major Scale: TTSTTTS

We decide (just because we want to) call this two scales **relatives**
