# Love & Passion

Yes, those 2 words describe the amazing feeling while I play.

Yes, those 2 words describe the incredible sensations that passed through my veins while listening 
to an orchestra that first night I arrived to London and my friend took me to the Royal Albert Hall.

That is why, this blog will document my learning, and I will be writing for me and for you to be able to follow.
I want to not only learn, but to share and to build new tools (I'm a Computer Engineer) that help others as well as myself.

I am thrilled (and terrified) about this idea of publicly documenting all my progress. Let's see what happens.


Yes, Love & Passion describe what I feel about music, join me in this quest.


Write to you soon!

Best,


Leo
