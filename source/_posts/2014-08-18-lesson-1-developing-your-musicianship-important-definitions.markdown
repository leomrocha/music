As writing helps me put ideas in order. I'll try to write a post for each lesson.
So here there is the first post of a series that will make it possible for me to track the progress made.

I hope is also useful for you too!

This series of post is dedicated to write down what I get from the online courses.

The study of chords, scales and melodies 

Harmony study inclues the analysis of chords progressions to show important relationships between chords and the key a song is in.
