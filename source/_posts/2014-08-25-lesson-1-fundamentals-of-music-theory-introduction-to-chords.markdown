When I listen to a beautiful piece of music, while my body feels the pleaszure of it, my minds tries to find different things. 
Among them, how to be able to play it with my guitar and sing it.

For playing it with the guitar I usually need to know the chords that are ther.

So, what are chords?


##Chords

So, for what I see and I do, I could say that:

A **chord** is a defined set of notes played at the same time.

So, for defining and naming them, it'll be good to have a way to do it with consistency and being able to everybody name and build chords in the same way.

For this, let's go back to the **C (Do) Major Scale** where we started basing our study.

### Let's repeat the **C Major Scale**:

    Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do -> Names - Latin speaking countries
    Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do -> Solfege sylabs
    C  D  E  F  G   A  B  C  -> Names -Saxon countries
    1  2  3  4  5   6  7  1  -> Scales degrees

Also, we have to repeat the intervals, but I'll also add the intervals that I didn't write in the previous post:


###Intervals
| Interval (semitones) 	| Name            	| Example 	|
|----------------------	|-----------------	|---------	|
| 0                    	| Unison          	| C-C     	|
| 1                    	| Minor 2nd (9th) 	| C-Db    	|
| 2                    	| Major 2nd (9th) 	| C-D     	|
| 3                    	| Minor 3rd       	| C-Eb    	|
| 4                    	| Major 3rd       	| C-E     	|
| 5                    	| Perfect 4th     	| C-F     	|
| 6                    	| Augmented 4th   	| C-F#    	|
|                      	| 5th Diminished  	|         	|
| 7                    	| Perfect 5th     	| C-G     	|
| 8                    	| Minor 6th       	| C-G#    	|
| 9                    	| Major 6th       	| C-A     	|
| 10                   	| Minor 7th       	| C-A#    	|
| 11                   	| Major 7th       	| C-B     	|
| 12                   	| Octave          	| C-C'    	|

If we simultaneourly play the **Tonic** and the **5th** we can hear a nice consonance.

Then we can take the **3rd** (major and minor 3rd) and play it with the tonic, it also sounds good.

Not lets form two sets, one with **(Tonic, 3rd, 5th)** and other: **(Tonic, min 3rd, 5th )**

If we play them we can listen to a small difference, we will call the first one **Major chord** and the second one **Minor chord**

and for the name of the chord we will use, as with the scales, the **Tonic**, that is, the first note.

So the following example will be to form the **C major** and **C minor** chords:

Well, that's all for chords today.
