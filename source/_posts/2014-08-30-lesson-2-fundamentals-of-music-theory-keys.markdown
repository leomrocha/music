On this post I'll review some points that I feel important, I will ignore some things that I feel are not so much, and I'll add some other points that I feel makes me understand things better.


#Keys, Key Signatures & Scales

[Key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music\) "Key") definition on wikipedia


Complex concept that contains different ideas:

 * The  relationship and emotion that a piece or part of a piece has. 
 * The **tonic** that gives the name a **key**, when we listen, is the one that attracts and feels that there the music rests.
 * All tension is resolved when the piece returns to the **key**

Lets look at different scales, that correspond to different keys.

If we look a piece in the respective **key** of the **tonic** of each scale, 
Always the same note will have the same [accidental](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_(music\) "Accidental") before.

We can give this information beforehand and make writing a piece easier using what is called a **Key Signature**

(see example in graphics below in key signature seccion)

##Key Signature

**Key Signature** is a way of writing music accidentals at the begginig of the stave. this has two effects:

 * Simplifies the writing
 * Gives us from the start information about what will happen during the piece

[Key Signature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signature "Key Signature") definition on wikipedia

Lets see all the scales, with and without the **Key Signature** written:

We can see that writing the key signature simplifies the writing and more clear

##Circles of 5ths and Circle of 4th

####Let's refresh the Intervals
| Interval (semitones) 	| Name            	| Example 	|
|----------------------	|-----------------	|---------	|
| 0                    	| Unison          	| C-C
| 1                    	| Minor 2nd (9th) 	| C-Db
| 2                    	| Major 2nd (9th) 	| C-D
| 3                    	| Minor 3rd       	| C-Eb
| 4                    	| Major 3rd       	| C-E
| 5                    	| Perfect 4th     	| C-F
| 6                    	| Augmented 4th   	| C-F#
| 6                    	| 5th Diminished  	| C-F#
| 7                    	| Perfect 5th     	| C-G
| 8                    	| Minor 6th       	| C-G#
| 9                    	| Major 6th       	| C-A 
| 10                   	| Minor 7th       	| C-A#
| 11                   	| Major 7th       	| C-B 
| 12                   	| Octave          	| C-C'

To find the circle of 4ths, 5ths, etc we have to **jump** this interval to get to the following note until we find the first note name with wich we started


###Circle of Fifths

Lets take all the notes and let's jump starting from the **C (Do)** in perfect 5ths.
So we have:

| C(Do) | G(Sol) | D(Re) | A(La) | E(Mi) | B(Si) | F#(Fa#) | Db(Re b) | Ab(La b) | Eb(Mi b) | Bb(Si b) | F(Fa) | C(Do) |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------|-------|


The itervals are always 7 semitones (perfect 5ths)


###Circle of Fourths

First lets again number the notes and start going up in fourths

The same as before, but now we'll be going in perfect 4ths, it's the same to say, every 5 semitones.

We can observe that as the circle of 5ths advances by 7 semitones, and the octave contains 12, the circle of 4ths will be the reverse of the circle of 5ths. Let's do it only for the major. Then we can count it for the relative minors too.

| C(Do) | F(Fa) | Bb(Si b) | Eb(Mi b) | Ab(La b) | Db(Re b) | Gb(Sol b) | B(Si) | E(Mi) | A(La) | D(Re) | G(Sol) | C(Do) |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------|


### SumUp Circles and Key Signatures

We can sumup everything in the following representation (from wikipedia)

This image contains all the major and relative minor scales witht the corresponding key signatures (for flat and sharp).
If we read it clockwise we see the circle of 5ths and if we read it counter-clockwise the circle of 4ths.

##More on Scales


Refreshing the definition of **Music Scale**

Is an ordered increasing in frequency sequence of notes.

[Music Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music\) "Music Scale") definition on wikipedia

### Major Scale

We have defined the major scale as a sequence that follows:

    TTSTTTS

Where:

    T = Tone
    S = Semitone

### Minor Scales

We've seen the Natural minor scale, but there are others, lets see:

A complete article on [minor scales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale "minor scales") on Wikipedia


#### Natural Minor Scale

We have defined the natural minor as a sequence that follows:

    TSTTSTT
    
#### Harmonic Minor Scale

In the Natural Minor Scale there is a **tone** between the **7th** (the last note of the sequence before the tonic) and the **tonic**. This is, the 7th is a **minor 7th**.

But we name the **major 7th** as the **leading tone**, that is, the note that leads to the **tone**. For this harmonic reason, we modify the Natural Minor Scale on the end and create the **Harmonic Minor Scale** as:

    TSTTS(T+S)S
 
#### Melodic Minor Scale

Singing the Harmonic Minor Scale is difficult, specially because of the Tone and a half, so there was another minor scale created to create an easier to sing melody, and this takes the form:

    TSTTTTS


We can see all three scales in the following example:
