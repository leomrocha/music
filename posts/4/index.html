			Last Week Sumup</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This blog is about the Lean way to learn music. Lean means trying to reduce waste as much as possible, and this is an iterative process.
So I&rsquo;m learning while doing, and the idea is to do the shortest possible iterations and realize when to change directions.</p>

<p>For sure there will be some waste, waste of time mainly. Waste of words for sure. The idea is to learn and to improve while doing. But always, being able to progress.</p>

<p>There is something great about writing down things, all progress (or non-progress) gets documented,
and even if I think that this little details do not matter, I&rsquo;ve realized that I do much
more when I have the obligation to write down the results and the plan was clear.</p>

<p>This week I did several things, but I still have a lot to learn in how to handle and organize all TODO list. I usually get distracted by something and keep on doing something that needs doing, but it&rsquo;s not necessarily the best order.</p>

<h2>1. What I did about Education &ndash; I started two different online courses:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Developing Your Musicianship &ndash; Cursera &ndash; Berklee College of Music &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002">https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002</a></li>
<li>Fundamentals of Music Theory &ndash; Cursera &ndash; University of Edinburg &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001">https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001</a></li>
</ol>


<p>The first one, is really practical and I love the way it&rsquo;s taught. Althogh I found it a bit difficult (and redundant, after writing down the first one) to write down in blog posts the lessons. I&rsquo;m trying to get the grip on a couple of ideas to make online tools to help practicing and learning the concepts easier.</p>

<p>The second one is really nice, as the title says, it&rsquo;s about theory, so I found it easier to be able to write down things.</p>

<h3>About how I managed the learning this week</h3>

<p>What I did well:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve actually made the first week progress for both courses, and I&rsquo;ve started with the second week</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve started writing down the progress in blog posts, even if this took time, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot</li>
<li>I started writing the posts when I was watching the videos, this helped me organize better the ideas and fix them better in my head</li>
<li>While writing down I realized that for the course <strong>Developing Your Musicianship</strong> I hadn&rsquo;t too much to write down, but instead I had to practice</li>
</ul>


<p>What I&rsquo;ve should have done better</p>

<ul>
<li>I did too many lessons in a row, this hindered my ability to write down things and organize them well in my head. At the end I had to watch some videos again and I&rsquo;m still missing one blog post (about chords)</li>
<li>I did not practice 15 minutes every day. Some days I practiced a couple of hours, while 1 day I didn&rsquo;t practice at all, one I didn&rsquo;t practice enough because I got distracted by a phone call and after that distracted by other thing. I have to be more rigorous about the practice.</li>
<li>One day I didn&rsquo;t started slow and easy and I made a bad movement, I felt pain and had to stop the practice for the day.</li>
</ul>


<h2>2. What I did about Services &ndash; I found a bug in musicpaste.com</h2>

<p><a href="http://musicpaste.com" title="MusicPaste">MusicPaste</a> is a free online service for writing, sharing and embedding music sheets.</p>

<p>It was born as something for myself but then I thought &ldquo;Maybe other people need it too!&rdquo;.
So I decided to make it a free service for other people to use it if they need it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found a problem in the application (yesterday actually), I&rsquo;ve located it and now I&rsquo;m correcting it. It&rsquo;s one of the priorities of the following week.</p>

<h3>About how I managed the learning this week</h3>

<p>What I did well:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have been actively using the site for creating the music sheets for <strong>this</strong> blog</li>
<li>I just saw a problem and started tackling it</li>
</ul>


<p>What I should have done better:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a huge TODO list for this site (many small details), I should have done one simple point.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t write down the ideas I got for other practice and learning tools.</li>
</ul>


<h2>3. What I did about Instruments &ndash; I bought a digital piano</h2>

<p>YES! It should be arriving next week!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled and anxious, and &hellip; I just want it NOW!</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next</h2>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve written down my sumup, now the important part that follows, the <strong>ACTIONS</strong> to take for next week.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<ul>
<li>Keep on doing the lessons</li>
<li>Watch one or two videos (if they seem to be really related) and write a blog post for each on the theory</li>
<li>Start writing down the exercises and drills that I do for the Musicianship course and post them. Do this after each video where practice is involved</li>
<li>Warm-up better before starting to play</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Success measures:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Do all the lessons of week 2 of both courses</li>
<li>Write posts that include all the theory of both courses up to the end of lesson 2</li>
<li>Having practiced 15 minutes every day (playing for fun doesn&rsquo;t count)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Services</h3>

<ul>
<li>Write down detailed ideas about tools that I have (for example the ear training tool and the scale practice tool I have in mind)</li>
<li>Make one improvement to <a href="http://musicpaste.com" title="MusicPaste">MusicPaste</a>. The priority fix the bug.</li>
<li>Decide one and only one new tool to start programming it. Write down the action plan for it.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Success measures:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Having in paper (or in the computer) a detail of the tools (at least ear training and scale practice tools)</li>
<li>Having a decition and action plan written down for which tool to start working on next</li>
<li>Having fixed the problem I found in musicpaste, as extra, having added (or started) working on another feature on the TODO list</li>
</ul>

			Lesson 1 - Fundamentals of Music Theory - More on Scales</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are three basic concepts to take from this lesson:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is a <strong>mode</strong></li>
<li>The definition of <strong>natural minor scale</strong></li>
<li>The definition of a <strong>relative minor</strong></li>
</ol>


<h2>Mode</h2>

<p>Modes is something I can&rsquo;t seem to grasp correctly, anyway, I&rsquo;ll give it a try, and hopefully I&rsquo;ll get to understand it better.</p>

<p>For the practical point of view for what I can get for the moment:</p>

<pre><code>A musical mode is simply a variation from where we start playing the sequence of notes.
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>Another way to name the scales
</code></pre>

<p>Reading the simple definition of <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode" title="Mode">Mode</a> in Wikipedia I can grasp what I stated before.</p>

<p>A more detailed explanation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)" title="Mode">Mode</a> in Wikipedia</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done an exaustive list of all the modes (with the TAB in case of need) here:</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Natural Minor Scale</h2>

<p>Lets choose arbitrarily one sequence of notes from the modes before.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s play in the keyboard all the white keys from <strong>A(La)</strong> to the next <strong>A(La)</strong> key.</p>

<iframe src="http://musicpaste.com/musicapp/embed_score/i2jotPALdxdAzbcHPFGCf7/" width="640px" height="380px"> <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> </iframe>


<p></p>

<h2>Relative Minor</h2>

<p>If now we see the relationships between the notes in the A(La) Natural Minor Scale, we will notice the following pattern of Tones and Semitones:</p>

<pre><code>TSTTSTT
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that is only a transposition of the C (Do) Major Scale: TTSTTTS</p>

<p>We decide (just because we want to) call this two scales <strong>relatives</strong></p>
