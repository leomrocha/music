			Studying Piano - Czerny Op.599 - 1</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>Music inspires a passion that cannot be explained by words</strong></p>

<h1>Starting from the beginning</h1>

<p>As an amateur guitar player, I&rsquo;ve spent many years <em>&ldquo;playing&rdquo;</em> without actually knowing what was I doing.
I have a nice music intuition, so I&rsquo;ve been able to pull up with <em>learning by ear</em> and with <em>TABs</em>
But after a while I hitted a roadblock, and what blocked me was the lack of understanding of the music.</p>

<p>The conclusion:</p>

<p>I should start studying music theory, and getting to deeply understand it.</p>

<p>So, I started a few weeks ago with a couple of online courses, I repeat here the links:</p>

<ol>
<li>Developing Your Musicianship &ndash; Cursera &ndash; Berklee College of Music &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002">https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002</a></li>
<li>Fundamentals of Music Theory &ndash; Cursera &ndash; University of Edinburg &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001">https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001</a></li>
</ol>


<p>Starting from the beginning allowed me to improve a lot in a few weeks.</p>

<h1>Learning piano</h1>

<p>For a long time I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of a piano. Piano and violin are two instruments that caught my attention since I was a toddler, but I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to do it. I got a guitar instead (and now I <strong>love</strong> guitars too).</p>

<p>So I bought the piano (thanks to all the ones who participated to help me buy this as a birthday gift! specially my girlfriend whom made the whole organization for it) and now the question was:</p>

<p>Do I keep on doing the same thing? or should I actually start from the beginning?</p>

<p>I decided I wanted to do it well, from the begining. And talking to a (pianist) friend of mine, she recommended <strong>Czerny, First Teacher of the Piano</strong></p>

<p>Czerny was a prodigy in music and also great music teacher.
Among his  teachers we can name Bethoven, Salieri and Hummel and Clementi.
Also, most of the greatest clasic musicians can be traced back to Czerny</p>

<p>More about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Czerny" title="Carl Czerny">Carl Czerny</a> on Wikipedia</p>

<p>So I took her advice and started from the first exercise in the book.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s in the public domain, you can find it here: <a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Practical_Exercises_for_Beginners,_Op.599_%28Czerny,_Carl%29">Practical Exercises for Beginners Op. 599</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imslp.org">IMSLP</a> is a great website for finding public domain music sheets.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s go to today&rsquo;s subject.</p>

<h2>Czerny Op. 599 &ndash; First exercise</h2>

<p>I started trying to read for the right and left hand and then going on with the whole exercise.</p>

<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve been able to read and do some things, this way didn&rsquo;t work as expected, and I kept on repeating many mistakes.</p>

<p>So I decided I&rsquo;ll analyze the exercise to understand it better,</p>

<p>I could extract the following facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s in <strong>C Major</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>tonic</strong> is <strong>C Major</strong></li>
<li>The mode is <strong>ionian</strong> because of the <strong>Tonic</strong></li>
<li>The clef for the right and left hand is the <strong>trebble</strong> clef</li>
</ul>


<p>I decided to extract 6 different parts of the exercise and this way I could practice better.</p>

<p>I practiced without schedule, some days a lot (up to one hour) some days a little (a few minutes), and even with the piano off. Anyway, the important is that all my senses get sharpened.</p>

<p>To cut it down I decided to practice individually the right and left hands. Also, I decided I would practice the measures in the following blocks and order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Measures 1,2 (the same as 3,4)</li>
<li>Measures 3</li>
<li>Measures 5,6</li>
<li>Measures 7,8</li>
<li>Measures 5 &ndash; 8</li>
<li>Measures 1 &ndash; 8</li>
<li>Measures 9,10</li>
<li>Measures 11,12</li>
<li>Measures 15,16</li>
<li> Measures 9 &ndash; 12</li>
<li> Measures 13 &ndash; 16</li>
<li> Measures 9 &ndash; 16</li>
</ol>


<p>Seems complex, but actually made me understand it better.</p>

<p>The right hand:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The left hand:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The whole melody (sorry about the notation that is for guitar, but VexTab doesn&rsquo;t yet support piano voices, so I&rsquo;ll put it only for you to be able to listen to the melody)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Yes, studying music takes time, and I love doing it, there is not one second I&rsquo;d rather be doing something else.</p>

<hr/>


<p>I should start recording myself and uploading the recordings &hellip; that&rsquo;s a good challenge for next week!</p>

			Last Week Sumup</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;m making this posts so I can learn more and better, and this week has been quite interesting.</p>

<p>The word <strong>lean</strong> in the blog theme is not because it should be easy, or fast, or no waste. But because the goal is to minimize the non-useful things, processes and be able to iterate <strong>fast</strong> and discard things that are not working.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve found out this week is that is not necesary the best idea to write a blog post per video in the lessons.</p>

<p>The second week of taking lessons was really interesting, I&rsquo;ve made lots of progress on my music just in this two weeks that I am really motivated to keep on studying.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still too impulsive and I have to improve my discipline with music.
I&rsquo;m used to playingwith my guitar, but discipline to actually study music is not my strongest point.</p>

<p>My new piano arrived Thursday night, and after that I was compeltely distracted with trying things, reading the manual, connecting it to the computer, etc. Luckily there are two friends at home now and both play piano well, so I&rsquo;ve been able to listen to nice things.</p>

<p>I tried playing some things. I was amazed how much could I really understand and do! I was waiting for not being able to do anything at all, but at least I&rsquo;ve been able to play a couple of melodies by ear, and start playing the first exercise of one of Czerny&rsquo;s piano methods!</p>

<p>I tested the USB-MIDI interface, is working great, and I&rsquo;m trying to find out how to build something that will help me in my learning path with it now. It will be web and I hope will be useful for other people too.</p>

<p>So, going to last week&rsquo;s goals:</p>

<p><strong>Last week goals:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Do all the lessons of week 2 of both courses &ndash;> DONE</li>
<li>Write posts that include all the theory of both courses up to the end of lesson 2 &ndash;> DONE (in a different way that the planned)</li>
<li><p>Having practiced 15 minutes every day (playing for fun doesn&rsquo;t count) &ndash;> MMMM, I&rsquo;ve practiced but not enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Having in paper (or in the computer) a detail of the tools (at least ear training and scale practice tools) &ndash;> plan changed, will do something more basic and easier first.</p></li>
<li>Having a decition and action plan written down for which tool to start working on next &ndash;> Changed, will create a web version of VMPK, but with synesthesia and be able to extend it for the learning tools later.</li>
<li>Having fixed the problem I found in musicpaste, as extra, having added (or started) working on another feature on the TODO list &ndash;> DONE, the fix. No extra</li>
</ul>


<h2>What&rsquo;s next</h2>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve written down my sumup, now the important part that follows, the <strong>ACTIONS</strong> to take for next week.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<ul>
<li>Keep on doing the lessons</li>
<li>Watch one or two videos (if they seem to be related) and write a blog post for each on the theory</li>
<li>Start writing down the exercises and drills that I do for the Musicianship course and post them. Do this after each video where practice is involved.</li>
<li>Warm-up better before starting to play</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Success measures:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Do all the lessons of week 3 of both courses</li>
<li>Write posts that include all the theory of both courses up to the end of lesson 3</li>
<li>Write down at least 2 drills for piano and 2 for guitar.</li>
<li>Having practiced 15 minutes every day (playing for fun doesn&rsquo;t count)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Services</h3>

<ul>
<li>Start the WMPK page (VMPK web port for Chrome)</li>
<li>Make one improvement to <a href="http://musicpaste.com" title="MusicPaste">MusicPaste</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Success measures:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Having a simple AngularJS web page that can read and show on screen the midi input from the piano and can send midi instructions to the piano.</li>
<li>Having added (or started if it&rsquo;s complex) one feature in the TODO list</li>
</ul>
