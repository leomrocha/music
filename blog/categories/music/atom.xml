    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From Pythagoras to the modern days, music has evolved, transformed and has become what is today.</p>

<p>Sounds where studied in different ways, music notation evolved, and also the definition of the notes.</p>

<p>Even if scales will be defined in later. Modern music is  studied in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale" title="Diatonic Scale">diatonic scale</a>
and is the one I&rsquo;m interested in using.</p>

<p>Relationships between notes are important, and here we study</p>

<p>We are going to look at vertical distances between notes</p>

<h2>Octaves</h2>

<p><strong>8 whole notes</strong>
An octave actually contains 12 notes.</p>

<p>If we use an instrument, we will be able to notice that every octave is &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; when studying (or listening) the relationships between the notes inside each octave.</p>

<p>And there is a relationship also between octaves. If we divide the frequency of the Nth note in the highest octave by the frequency of the Nth note of the lowest octave, it will always result in an integer.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take as one example is <strong>La</strong> 440Hz</p>

<pre><code>Going lower than 440Hz: **La** also exist in 220Hz, 110Hz, 55Hz

Going higher than **La** 440Hz we have 880Hz, 1760Hz, 3520Hz, etc
</code></pre>

<h2>Distances</h2>

<h3>Semitone:</h3>

<pre><code>Smallest working distance we can have between 2 notes.

Distance between two consecutive notes
</code></pre>

<p>In the diatonic scale we have 12 notes, the minimum distance is called <strong>semitone</strong></p>

<h3>Tone:</h3>

<pre><code>Distance  of 2 semitones
</code></pre>

<h2>Intervals:</h2>

<ul>
<li>2nd: 2 semitones C (Do) &ndash;> D (Re)</li>
<li>3rd: 4 semitones C (Do) &ndash;> E (Mi)</li>
<li>4th: 5 semitones C (Do) &ndash;> F (Fa)</li>
<li>5th: 7 semitones C (Do) &ndash;> G (Sol)</li>
<li>6th: 9 semitones C (Do) &ndash;> A (La)</li>
<li>7th: 11 semitones C (Do) &ndash;>  B (Si)</li>
<li>Octave: 12  semitones C (Do)&ndash;> C (Do) of next octave</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scale:</h2>

<p>The way I see an scale is an ordered and defined sequence of different notes.
The order is from lower to higher pitch</p>

<p>We can say that is the <strong>path</strong> trough an octave</p>

<p>For example, the C Major Scale as we read below.</p>

<h2>C Major Scale</h2>

<p>The nice thing about creating something, is that you get to name it the way you want.
So, lets imagine that we are the creators of C Major Scale, we decided how to define it and we named it as <strong>C Major Scale</strong> or equivalently <strong>Do Major Scale</strong></p>

<p>We take our piano (imagine you have a piano, use yours, or use one online), and we find any  <strong>C (Do)</strong></p>

<p>Then from that note, we play all the white keys up to the next <strong>C (Do)</strong></p>

<p>And we decide that we will call this scale the <strong>C (Do) Major Scale</strong>:</p>

<p>So now we have this awesome scale, with a name.</p>

<p>The most important thing to note, is that our ear cares a lot about the relationships between notes, so lets see this scale:</p>

<p>There are white keys notes that have a black key in between, and there are other white keys that dont.</p>

<p>As we said before, the minimum interval between two notes is a <strong>semitone</strong>.</p>

<p>We assign a the <strong>T</strong> to a Tone interval and the <strong>S</strong> to a Semitone interval</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s analyze the  <strong>C (Do) Major Scale</strong></p>

<p>We can see that the pattern formed is: <strong>TTSTTTS</strong></p>

<p>So now we decide to call <strong>ANY</strong> scale that contains this tone and semitone pattern the <strong>Major Scale</strong> and as we did with the  <strong>C (Do) Major Scale</strong> we will name the scale with the first note, so if we start from <strong>D</strong> and we follow the same pattern, we will call it the  <strong>D (Re) Major Scale</strong>.</p>

<p>Another definition: The <strong>TONIC</strong> is the note that gives the scale the name.</p>

<p>That is all for the sumup of this lesson. Next post will be more about scales.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Music Notes</h1>

<p>When I think about a music note my mind creates a sound that I can recognize, and then, when I find it in my guitar I can put a name on it to tell somebody else what note I have sounding in my head.</p>

<p>So for the practical point of view of how I see it:</p>

<p>A <strong>music note</strong> is a concept that links</p>

<pre><code>1. A Pitch
2. A Name
</code></pre>

<p>A more formal definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note" title="Music Note">Music Note</a> in Wikipedia</p>

<h2>Sound</h2>

<p>Definition:</p>

<pre><code>For the practical point of view a sound is anyhing that we can listen to.
</code></pre>

<p>A more formal definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound" title="Sound">Sound</a> in Wikipedia</p>

<p>There is one main characteristic of sound is the idea that is <strong>low</strong> or <strong>high</strong></p>

<p>A sound can be <strong>singable</strong> if we (anyone) manage(s) to sing it or <strong>not singable</strong> otherwise. But going further to the definition. Singable means that we can identify and reproduce it, while not singable means that we have a rough idea of its <strong>high</strong> or <strong>low</strong> quality but not able to actually identify it with a single note.</p>

<h2>Pitch</h2>

<p>Is a quality of sound that allows us to identify and order it.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)" title="Pitch">Pitch</a> in Wikipedia</p>

<h2>Naming the notes</h2>

<p>For naming the notes, there is the need to have a notation that allows us to reproduce the same idea with the same symbols.</p>

<p>This way, we introduce the <strong>stave</strong> that allows us to do it.</p>

<h3>Stave</h3>

<pre><code>5 lines and 4 spaces in between
</code></pre>

<p>The lines in the Stave means nothing without knowing how to start naming the notes.</p>

<p>For this naming there are the <strong>clefs</strong> that indicates that a certain line corresponds to a certain note.</p>

<p>For exemple, the <strong>G clef</strong> also called <strong>Trebble Clef</strong></p>

<p>An example, with also the TAB style below (for guitar players)</p>

<p>This example corresponds to the following names:</p>

<pre><code>Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do -&gt; Names - Latin speaking countries
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do -&gt; Solfege sylabs
C  D  E  F  G   A  B  C  -&gt; Names -Saxon countries
1  2  3  4  5   6  7  1  -&gt; Scales degrees
</code></pre>

<p>When a note is in a place where there are no lines around (above or below the 5 lines), we write a small line called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger_line" title="Ledger Line">ledger line</a>.</p>

<p>For the purpose of</p>

<h3>Reading &ndash; mnemotechnics</h3>

<p>Mnemotechnics for the lines:
EGBDF &ndash; Every Good Boy Deserves Food</p>

<p>Pnemotechnics for the spaces:
FACE &ndash; face</p>

<p>Here you can see an actual example:</p>
