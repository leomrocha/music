    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Music inspires a passion that cannot be explained by words</strong></p>

<h1>Starting from the beginning</h1>

<p>As an amateur guitar player, I&rsquo;ve spent many years <em>&ldquo;playing&rdquo;</em> without actually knowing what was I doing.
I have a nice music intuition, so I&rsquo;ve been able to pull up with <em>learning by ear</em> and with <em>TABs</em>
But after a while I hitted a roadblock, and what blocked me was the lack of understanding of the music.</p>

<p>The conclusion:</p>

<p>I should start studying music theory, and getting to deeply understand it.</p>

<p>So, I started a few weeks ago with a couple of online courses, I repeat here the links:</p>

<ol>
<li>Developing Your Musicianship &ndash; Cursera &ndash; Berklee College of Music &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002">https://class.coursera.org/musicianship-002</a></li>
<li>Fundamentals of Music Theory &ndash; Cursera &ndash; University of Edinburg &ndash; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001">https://class.coursera.org/musictheory-001</a></li>
</ol>


<p>Starting from the beginning allowed me to improve a lot in a few weeks.</p>

<h1>Learning piano</h1>

<p>For a long time I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of a piano. Piano and violin are two instruments that caught my attention since I was a toddler, but I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to do it. I got a guitar instead (and now I <strong>love</strong> guitars too).</p>

<p>So I bought the piano (thanks to all the ones who participated to help me buy this as a birthday gift! specially my girlfriend whom made the whole organization for it) and now the question was:</p>

<p> Do I keep on doing the same thing? or should I actually start from the beginning</p>

<h2>Czerny Op. 599 &ndash; First exercise</h2>

<p>I started trying to read for the right and left hand and then going on with the whole exercise.</p>

<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve been able to read and do some things, this way didn&rsquo;t work as expected, and I kept on repeating many mistakes.</p>

<p>So I decided I&rsquo;ll analyze the exercise to understand it better,</p>

<p>I could extract the following facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s in <strong>C Major</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>tonic</strong> is <strong>C Major</strong></li>
<li>The mode is <strong>ionian</strong> because of the <strong>Tonic</strong></li>
<li>The clef for the right and left hand is the <strong>trebble</strong> clef</li>
</ul>


<p>I decided to extract 6 different parts of the exercise and this way I could practice better.</p>

<p>I practiced without schedule, some days a lot (up to one hour) some days a little (a few minutes), and even with the piano off. Anyway, the important is that all my senses get sharpened.</p>

<p>To cut it down I decided to practice individually the right and left hands. Also, I decided I would practice the measures in the following blocks and order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Measures 1,2 (the same as 3,4)</li>
<li>Measures 3</li>
<li>Measures 5,6</li>
<li>Measures 7,8</li>
<li>Measures 5 &ndash; 8</li>
<li>Measures 1 &ndash; 8</li>
<li>Measures 9,10</li>
<li>Measures 11,12</li>
<li>Measures 15,16</li>
<li> Measures 9 &ndash; 12</li>
<li> Measures 13 &ndash; 16</li>
<li> Measures 9 &ndash; 16</li>
</ol>


<p>Seems complex, but actually made me understand it better.</p>

<p>The right hand:</p>

<p>The whole melody (sorry about the notation that is for guitar, but VexTab doesn&rsquo;t yet support piano voices, so I&rsquo;ll put it only for you to be able to listen to the melody)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Yes, studying music takes time, and I love doing it, there is not one second I&rsquo;d rather be doing something else.</p>

<hr/>


<p>I should start recording myself and uploading the recordings &hellip; that&rsquo;s a good challenge for next week!</p>
